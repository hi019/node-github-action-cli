This repo shows an example Express.js app that is run on Zeet, and is automatically redeployed on every commit, 
through [action-zeet](https://github.com/zeet-dev/action-zeet).

Note: Zeet automatically redeploys code by default. This example uses Manual Deploy instead, as to not create two 
deployments on every commit:
